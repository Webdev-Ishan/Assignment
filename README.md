# ðŸ“Œ Remind-me-later

**Remind-me-later** is a simple backend API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create reminders by submitting a message, date, time, and preferred notification method (Email or SMS). This backend is designed to work with a frontend UI that handles input from users. The API receives this input and stores the reminder details in a MongoDB database.

Note: This project only stores reminder information; actual delivery of SMS or emails is not handled here.
